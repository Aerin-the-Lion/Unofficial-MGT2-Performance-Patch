# Unofficial MGT2 Performance Patch for Mad Games Tycoon 2(Mod)

## Motivation for Creating the Mod:
I created this mod due to numerous instances where unnecessary processes were being executed hundreds of times, leading to significant lag issues.<br>
The aim is to rectify these problems.<br>
Additionally, I plan to gradually add various performance improvement features, ensuring that only tested mods are released.<br>
無駄な処理を数百回も行っていたところがあり、そのせいで莫大なラグが発生することが多々あるため、それらを修正するために作成しました。<br>
なお、順次様々なパフォーマンス改善機能を追加する予定であり、テスト済みのModのみを公開しています。<br>

## How to Use:
The mod is designed to work simply by installing it.<br>
If not needed, you can disable it via the Config settings.<br>
<br>
基本的に、インストールするだけで機能します。<br>
必要なければ、Configでオフにしてください。<br>

## Features
- GameDev Menu - Performance Improvement
Fixes short-term freezing of the game during the initialization of the Game Development Menu due to a vast number of unnecessary processes.
(Patches the system to prevent unnecessary processes that occur as many times as the number of unlocked game features.The performance improvement effect becomes more significant as you approach the endgame.)

ゲーム開発メニューの初期化時、膨大な無駄な処理の結果、ゲームが短時間フリーズするのを修正します。
（アンロックされたゲーム機能の数の分だけ、無駄な処理をするのをパッチしています。Endgameになるにつれ、パフォーマンス改善効果が顕著になります。）

Performance Improvement Evaluation: Starting in the year 2015
 (with 71 game features unlocked)
Original : Stopwatch Timer Log - took 4110 milliseconds.
Modded : Stopwatch Timer Log - took 160 milliseconds.
